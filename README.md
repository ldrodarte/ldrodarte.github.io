Map of my favorite places i've vistied in the past year. 

I spent majority of covid in Anaheim so I didn't actually visit. 

While in highschool my friends and I would often go to Fullerton to hang out, I still go sometime.Just about a year ago I last went to Balboa Beach with my friends and haven't seent them since :(.

I went to Jerez in mexico to visit my mom when covid restrictions were loose enough to allow, we didn't know when would be the next we saw eachother. 

In January I was able to move into a UCSB apartment and I've been chilling here since. For spring break a friend and I went to Joshua Tree National Park and stayed in Twentynine Palms.
